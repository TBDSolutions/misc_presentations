### Person-Centered

???
### Notes:

The framework developed must support a person-centered approach to service planning by making concrete choices in its design, which go beyond merely paying lip-service to person-centered planning.  These design decisions include the following:
- *Not* automating services or amounts
- Recommendation of a menu of relevant services (*based on a person's needs*) which the person can select from.
- Providing coherent categories to choose from in order to increase satisfaction with choice ([Mogilner, 2008](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/706b/84d3567ba03939c3748c94dae36a74a5a64f.pdf))
- Framing the recommended thresholds as 'recommendations': defaults which can be overridden based on personal choice and medical necessity determination.
- "*We show the dots, but the person needs to connect the dots.  And they can draw outside of the lines when needed.*"

### Framework
#### (Consistent, comprehensive)

???
### Notes:

- In order for ease of implementation and explanation, there should be a consistent conceptual framework which applies across populations.
- This does not mean that there is not complxity built into the 'back-end', but that the resulting model should be simple to explain and use (*cf. iPhone setup*)
- The model should include a method to monitor the use of all services across all populations, though this method may be different for different services (*e.g. intake and assessment, where a person has not yet had a determination of need*)

### Lines, Not Walls

???
### Notes:

â€“ We are recommending service thresholds based on assessed need.  
- Nothing within the thresholds are magic, they have to fit within a process
- The model *does not* put a cap on the number of units of a particular service type.
- Since no tool perfectly captures medical necessity criteria, the guidance is to start with the recommended thresholds and to revise them if they do not make 'clinical sense'.
- Thresholds should be considered initial sketches of what the person might receive. They can be revised up or down based on clinical assessment of medical necessity.
- Having ranges or thresholds can never presume that the number of units recommended is either: (a) an absolute exclusion, or (b) a benefit that one is entitled to. *Example*:  If a doctor tells you that it is typical for people to have a 3-day stay following a C-section, this does not mean that (a) you may not stay longer if needed, or (b) if you are ready to leave after 1 day, you can choose to stay for the other two as well.
- Any system that draws boundaries/thresholds is bound to draw them in a way which does not account for an individual's situation.  Thus, there needs to be a process (*and not an onerous, painful process*) so people can redraw the boundary (i.e. exception process)
- Differences between levels have to be dotted lines and not walls.

### Equity

???
### Notes:

- PIHPs are responsible to provide a regional benefit, with consistent and standardized eligibility criteria
- The intent of this model is that no matter where people show up, they will have access to a consistent benefit.
- It shouldn't matter what door you enter, you should be eligible for the same services anywhere in the region
- Equity takes relevant needs into consideration.  In the current model, it is based on level/type of need and disability population.

### Common Goods

???
### Notes:

- The model is based on needs, and modified based on medical necessity.
- That said, there is recognition that resources are finite, and must be shared equitably among those accessing them.
- If needs exceed resources, then what is the most equitable means of distributing resources?
- The initial development of this model has been based on the assumption that, because (a) it is based on previous service use and (b) these previous services were provided based on medical necessity, and (c) the region did not previously overrun budgets, and (d) the recommended thresholds are more circumscribed than previous LOC versions, then (e) it is likely that the model will not 
- While we are trying to achieve regional consistency (potentially statewide consistency) - there is tension due to the contract requirements to both have to meet individuals needs and ensure you have adequate resources to meet everyone's need (need to find the Medicaid language for this point)
- The lines we draw can overrun budgets or underrun budgets....acknowledging the fiscal realities of this tension is critical

### Terminology

???
### Notes:
- The phrase 'Level of Care' is used in conversations to mean various things: from 'level of need', to 'level of service needed', to 'level of service authorized'
- We started by defining our terms, clarifying what we meant by:

### Data Informed

.pull-right[
- Policy-based scoping
- Needs-based episodes
- Service groupings
- Maximum use
- Excluding outliers
]

???
### Notes:
Our assumption is that previous use of services was usually appropriate and based on the need indicated by the assessment.
- *Policy-based scoping*: Filtering/defining service scope based on policy considerations
- *Needs-based episodes*: Make inter-assessment episodes of service.  Group by level of need (e.g. in LOCUS, this was the clinician-adjusted LOC score)
- *Service groupings*: Group services by type
- *Maximum use*: Find maximum per-person values for each HCPCS code
- *Excluding outliers*: Remove upper-end outliers. Select resulting value as the recommended upper threshold

Types of Service
- Rationale: Simplifying options increases participation ([Iyengar, 2010](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/4519/simplicitySeeking.pdf))
- High and low utilization of one service should not be looked at only in isolation, often the entire package of service utilization will provide a more comprehensive view.
- Example: Instead of having a lower threshold for both T1016 and T1017, combine both of these into a 'Care Coordination' group which has a higher threshold to allow fluidity in moving between services as necessary.
- Allowing for a choice of multiple relevant services while controlling for use of multiple similar services

### Iterative Testing

#### (a.k.a. Try, try again)

???
### Notes:
- Developed output to demonstrate the real-world impact that setting certain parameters would have on existing processes.
- Multiple UM and clinical reviews of output to ensure face validity; this involved retrospective review of individual cases which were flagged using each iteration of the logic
